Low employee engagement drives a $438 billion gap in global productivity each year. Engagement 
is often overlooked amongst senior leaders to the detriment of real,tangible business results.

Employee engagement is often confused with job satisfaction, but they're fundamentally different 
measures. Satisfaction reflects contentment with pay, benefits, or work conditions. Engagement 
reflects psychological ownership. It's the degree to which employees invest discretionary effort 
and drive toward organizational goals. The distinction matters because satisfied employees may 
be content but passive, while engaged employees actively drive performance.

Decades of research have now established engagement not as a mere correlation, but as a leading 
indicator of business outcomes. Gallup's latest meta-analysis across hundreds of organizations 
confirms this predictive power. Companies in the top quartile (highly engaged) outperformed 
their peers in the bottom-quartile with 18% higher sales productivity and 23% higher 
profitability, a stark and financially material difference.

To what do we owe these impressive results? The improved financials are driven by two overarching 
factors, revenue expansion and operational efficiency. While Gallup doesn't give us the exact 
behaviors that lead to better financial performance, they do call out several outcomes where a 
meaningful difference in measurements were shown to point us in the right direction, such as a 
reduction in absenteeism, theft, and turnover, and an increase in quality, customer engagement, 
and organizational participation.

Looking only at turnover numbers, low-turnover companies with highly engaged employees experienced 
43% lower turnover than their peers. Just the direct costs of turnover are substantial: recruiting 
fees, signing bonuses, and relocation expenses, to name a few. All the indirect costs, such as lost 
productivity while the job remains unfilled, time to recruit and onboard a replacement, stress of 
the remaining team members while being understaffed can be enormously impactful and of course vary 
by company and company composition. Imagine what these factors could cause in your own company 
organization.

When engagement rises, these costs disappear and the gains compound across every dimension of 
organizational performance. The question isn't whether to invest in engagement, but whether you 
can afford not to.
